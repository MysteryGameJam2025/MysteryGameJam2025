Our land, our beautiful land and our ways were wonderful. I miss them greatly down here. I'm thinking back to the golden age of unity and prosperity. It seems so far away now, but we keep talking about it so that we don't forget. I can't understand how they could do that to us. When they first arrived, they could not even farm, they could not even live off of the land. We took them in, and they displaced us. For a long time we hoped, at least, to share. Now we don't even know what to hope for, except that the next life is better than this.

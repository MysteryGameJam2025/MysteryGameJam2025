I met you on a beautiful night and I spent my life with you. I never tired of being with you. I never wanted to be anyone but who I was with you. We lived in a peaceful time of good people, and we raised our child among them. We grew older and little changed. We could not even imagine change. We were too content. I know now that I was a fool, and I wish that I was a fool still, because all I have learned from my experience is loss. I miss you and our baby so much. I will continue so that I might see you again one day.

Our oppression and our desperation grew, and what followed was a prolonged period of uncertainty. We tried our best to bargain and resolve the crisis by any means, but all attempts were unsuccessful, until our only choice was to go underground. We retreated into the sacred caves that were once scarcely inhibited, now overpopulated. Our determination remained but our means were so limited that we simply began to fall to famine and disease. Our culture changed, slowly but surely, into one that embraced an ending, and we began to find comfort in being in our final chapter. My loves, we will be together soon.
